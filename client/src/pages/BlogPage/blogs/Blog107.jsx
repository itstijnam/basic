            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Dull Living Room to Cozy Retreat</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Before: A basic living room with white walls, mismatched furniture, and poor lighting.<br></br>
              After: With a soft beige feature wall, layered rugs, matching seating, and ambient lighting, the space becomes a warm and inviting retreat. Throw pillows, plants, and framed art added the final touch—comfort meets style.
              <br></br>
              Design Tip: Use lighting and textiles to bring warmth and cohesion to any room.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Outdated Kitchen to Modern Minimalist</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Before: Old wooden cabinets, yellowing countertops, and cluttered open shelves made the kitchen look dated and cramped.
              <br></br>
              After: Sleek white cabinets, a subway tile backsplash, and matte black hardware created a clean, modern vibe. The clutter was cleared with smart storage solutions, and pendant lights added a contemporary touch.
              <br></br>
              Design Tip: Stick to a neutral palette with contrasting accents for a timeless kitchen look.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Boring Bedroom to Serene Sanctuary</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Before: Bare walls, a basic bedframe, and no clear design direction. <br></br>
              After: Soft gray walls, a statement headboard, layered bedding, and a gallery wall transformed the space into a calm and stylish sanctuary. Curtains and a bedside lamp added function and mood lighting.
              <br></br>
              Design Tip: Your bedroom should reflect calmness—invest in good lighting, soft textures, and soothing colors.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Forgotten Balcony to Outdoor Escape</h2>
            <p className=" mt-2">Before: A dusty, unused balcony with plain tiles and no seating.<br></br>
              After: Artificial grass, cozy floor seating, fairy lights, and potted plants turned it into a relaxing reading nook. A small coffee table made it perfect for morning tea or evening chats.
              <br></br>
              Design Tip: Don’t underestimate small spaces—outdoor corners can become your favorite hangout spot with the right décor.
