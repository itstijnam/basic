            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Biophilic Design: Bringing Nature Indoors</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Biophilic design continues to grow in popularity, blurring the line between indoor and outdoor living. Incorporating natural elements—such as indoor plants, water features, wood finishes, and ample natural light—can enhance well-being and reduce stress. In 2025, look for statement green walls, indoor gardens, and earthy color palettes that reflect a strong connection to nature.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Warm Minimalism: Comfort Meets Simplicity</h2>
            <p className="mt-2"> Minimalism gets a cozy makeover this year. Warm minimalism focuses on clean lines and decluttered spaces but adds warmth through soft textures, neutral tones, and natural materials. Think linen curtains, curved furniture, and organic shapes. This trend offers the best of both worlds: simplicity without sacrificing comfort.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Smart Homes with Stylish Tech</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Technology is seamlessly integrating into our interiors. From voice-activated lighting and temperature controls to hidden charging stations and furniture with built-in tech, homes in 2025 are becoming smarter and more efficient. What’s new is the focus on aesthetics—smart devices are now designed to blend into your décor, enhancing both function and form.</p>

            <p className=" mt-2">In 2025, ceilings and floors are no longer afterthoughts—they’re focal points. Expect bold patterns, painted ceilings, wooden beams, and geometric floor tiles to take center stage. These elements add depth and personality to a room, making it feel curated from top to bottom.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">5. Sustainable and Recycled Materials</h2>
            <p className=" mt-2">As environmental consciousness continues to grow, so does the demand for eco-friendly interiors. Designers are choosing recycled, upcycled, and sustainable materials more than ever. From reclaimed wood furniture to terrazzo made from post-consumer waste, 2025 is about making choices that are both stylish and responsible.
