        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1.  Understand the Mood of Each Room</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Start by identifying the mood you want for each room. Do you want your bedroom to feel calm and restful? Or your kitchen to feel energizing and fresh? Soft blues and greens are perfect for serenity, while bold reds and yellows bring vibrancy and warmth. Tailor your palette to the purpose and atmosphere of the space.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2.  Find Inspiration from Your Surroundings</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Look for inspiration in nature, artwork, fashion, or even your favorite coffee shop. Save images that make you feel good and observe the color combinations that catch your eye. Tools like Pinterest or color palette generators can help you visualize how different hues work together.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Start with a Base Color</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Choose a base or dominant color that will set the tone for your home—usually a neutral like white, beige, grey, or soft taupe. This shade will appear throughout the house and provide a consistent backdrop that ties all rooms together. It creates a balanced canvas for layering accent colors.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Consider Natural Light and Room Orientation</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">The amount of natural light a room gets significantly affects how colors appear. North-facing rooms may benefit from warmer tones to counteract cooler light, while bright, south-facing spaces can handle cooler or bolder hues. Always test paint samples in different lighting before committing.
