        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Choose Light Colors to Open Up the Space</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Light colors such as whites, creams, soft greys, and pastels reflect more light, making the room appear larger and airier. Use these shades for walls, ceilings, and larger furniture pieces to create a sense of openness. Pair them with natural light and sheer curtains to further enhance the spacious feel.</p>

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Opt for Multi-Functional Furniture</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">In a small living room, every piece of furniture should serve more than one purpose. Consider ottomans with hidden storage, sofa beds, nesting tables, or TV units with built-in shelving. These pieces help reduce clutter while maximizing functionality.

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Use Mirrors to Reflect Light and Create Depth</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Mirrors are a designer’s secret weapon for small spaces. Placing a large mirror across from a window bounces natural light around the room and gives the illusion of more square footage. Try mirrored furniture or a gallery wall with reflective frames for added elegance.</p>

      </div>


      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Go Vertical with Storage and Decor</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">When floor space is limited, think vertically. Use tall bookcases, wall-mounted shelves, and vertical art pieces to draw the eye upward. This not only adds storage but also makes the ceiling appear higher, giving the room a more expansive look.

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">5. Choose the Right-Size Furniture</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">Avoid oversized furniture that overwhelms the room. Instead, opt for sleek, low-profile sofas and chairs with exposed legs to maintain a sense of openness. A glass coffee table or acrylic furniture can also help keep the room feeling light and unobstructed.
