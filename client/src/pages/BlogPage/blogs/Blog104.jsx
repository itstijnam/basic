    <p className="text-lg mt-2">The modern kitchen is no longer just a place to cook—it’s the heart of the home, a space that blends aesthetics, efficiency, and innovation. As lifestyles shift, kitchens are becoming more streamlined, organized, and personalized. From minimalist layouts to smart storage solutions, modern kitchen design in today’s homes emphasizes both beauty and function. Here’s how to bring this balance into your space.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Embrace Minimalist Layouts</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Modern kitchens thrive on simplicity. Clean lines, clutter-free countertops, and a neutral color palette create a calm and organized atmosphere. Handleless cabinets, integrated appliances, and hidden storage contribute to a seamless look that feels sleek and sophisticated. The idea is to do more with less—without sacrificing convenience.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Maximize Functionality with Smart Storage</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Functionality is key in any modern kitchen. Pull-out pantry units, corner drawers, vertical storage racks, and deep drawers for pots and pans help keep everything within reach yet out of sight. Customized cabinetry and modular shelving ensure every inch is utilized efficiently, especially in smaller layouts.

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Incorporate Smart Technology</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Tech-forward kitchens are on the rise. From touchless faucets and motion-sensor lighting to smart ovens and voice-controlled assistants, technology is transforming the way we cook and clean. These modern conveniences not only enhance functionality but also contribute to a more hygienic and efficient kitchen experience.</p>

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4.  Use High-Quality, Easy-to-Maintain Materials</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">Modern kitchens are designed for everyday life. Durable, low-maintenance materials like quartz countertops, matte finishes, stainless steel, and high-gloss laminates are both stylish and practical. These surfaces resist stains, scratches, and moisture, making cleanup quick and easy.</p>

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">5.  Add Personality with Accents and Textures</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">While minimalism sets the foundation, modern design doesn’t mean sterile. Add warmth and personality through wooden elements, metal fixtures, statement backsplashes, or open shelving with curated decor. A pop of color on the cabinets or a textured island counter can bring your kitchen to life.</p>      </div>
