          <p className="text-lg mt-2">Sustainability is no longer a trend—it’s a responsibility. As we become more environmentally conscious, the way we design our living spaces is evolving too. Sustainable interior design focuses on reducing environmental impact, using eco-friendly materials, and creating healthier homes. Whether you’re renovating or redecorating, here are some simple yet powerful ways to make your interior design more eco-conscious.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1.  Choose Sustainable Materials</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Opt for materials that are renewable, biodegradable, or recycled. Bamboo, reclaimed wood, cork, and rattan are excellent alternatives to conventional materials. Not only are they durable and stylish, but they also reduce the demand for virgin resources.
              <br></br>
              Eco Tip: Look for certifications like FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) or GREENGUARD to ensure your materials are environmentally responsible.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Upcycle and Repurpose Furniture</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Instead of buying new, consider breathing new life into old pieces. A fresh coat of non-toxic paint or reupholstering a vintage chair can give it a modern twist. Upcycling helps reduce waste and adds a unique character to your space.
              <br></br>
              Eco Tip: Scout thrift stores, flea markets, or online marketplaces for pre-loved gems.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Use Low-VOC Paints and Finishes</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Traditional paints often release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that pollute indoor air. Low-VOC or zero-VOC paints are safer for your health and the environment while still offering a wide range of colors and finishes.
              <br></br>
              Eco Tip: Always ventilate rooms during and after painting, even with low-VOC options.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Maximize Natural Light and Ventilation</h2>
            <p className=" mt-2">Design with nature in mind. Utilize large windows, light-colored walls, and mirrors to reflect natural light. Good ventilation reduces the need for air purifiers and maintains a healthier indoor climate.
              <br></br>
              Eco Tip: Use sheer curtains or solar blinds to balance light and temperature naturally.

          <p className="text-lg">
            Sustainable interior design isn’t about compromising on style—it’s about making mindful choices that benefit both your home and the planet. By embracing eco-friendly materials, energy-efficient practices, and natural elements, you create a space that feels good and does good. Start small, stay consistent, and let your home reflect a greener future.
