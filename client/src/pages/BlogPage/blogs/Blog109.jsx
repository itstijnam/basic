          <p className="text-lg mt-2">In today’s fast-paced world, our homes should be more than just places to eat and sleep—they should serve as sanctuaries that nurture our physical, mental, and emotional well-being. A wellness-focused home prioritizes comfort, mindfulness, and holistic health by incorporating thoughtful design elements. Here’s how you can transform your home into a haven that promotes overall wellness.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Embrace Natural Light and Air</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Sunlight boosts mood, regulates sleep, and enhances productivity. Maximize natural light by using sheer curtains, placing mirrors to reflect light, and keeping windows clean and unobstructed. Fresh air is equally important—improve indoor air quality with proper ventilation and by keeping windows open when possible.
              <br></br>
              Wellness Tip: Install air-purifying plants like aloe vera, peace lilies, or spider plants to cleanse the air naturally.</p>

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Create Calm with Color</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Colors deeply influence our emotions. Use soft, soothing tones like pale blue, sage green, and warm neutrals to create a peaceful atmosphere. Avoid overly bold or contrasting colors in relaxation zones like bedrooms or meditation spaces.
              <br></br>
              Wellness Tip: Use color intentionally—blues for calm, greens for balance, and neutrals for grounding energy.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Choose Wellness-Friendly Materials</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Opt for natural, non-toxic, and eco-friendly materials in furniture and décor. Avoid materials that emit harmful chemicals (like some plastics and treated woods). Organic cotton, linen, bamboo, and untreated wood are great wellness-friendly choices.
              <br></br>
              Wellness Tip: Check for certifications like OEKO-TEX or GOTS when buying textiles.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Prioritize Sleep with a Thoughtful Bedroom Setup</h2>
            <p className=" mt-2">GGood sleep is essential for wellness. Invest in a quality mattress, blackout curtains, and soft lighting. Keep electronics away from the bed and use calming scents like lavender to promote better rest.
              <br></br>
              Wellness Tip: A noise machine or essential oil diffuser can enhance the sleep environment.

          <p className="text-lg">
            Designing a wellness-focused home is about creating spaces that make you feel safe, inspired, and recharged. Through intentional choices—like optimizing natural light, using calming colors, and incorporating nature—you can cultivate an environment that supports your well-being on every level. Remember, your home should be a reflection of the harmony and peace you seek in life.
