        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Start with a Clear Plan</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Before spending a rupee, map out your goals. Decide which rooms need the most attention and what changes will have the greatest effect—be it new wall colors, updated furniture, or lighting. A clear plan helps avoid impulse buys and ensures every decision supports your overall design vision.</p>

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Refresh with Paint</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Paint is one of the most affordable ways to dramatically change a space. A fresh coat in a new color can completely alter the mood and brightness of a room. Go bold on a feature wall or stick to calming neutrals to make your space feel larger and cleaner.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Rearrange and Repurpose</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">Sometimes all it takes is a new layout. Try repositioning furniture to improve flow and functionality. Repurpose existing items in creative ways—turn an old ladder into a bookshelf, or use vintage crates for storage. You’ll save money and add a personal touch to your décor.</p>

      <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Upgrade with Accessories</h2>
        <p className=" mt-2">Cushions, rugs, curtains, and throws are cost-effective accents that instantly elevate a room. Mix textures and patterns to add depth and style. Don’t underestimate the power of a new set of cushions or a trendy lamp to breathe life into a dull corner.
