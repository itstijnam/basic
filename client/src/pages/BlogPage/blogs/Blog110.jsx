            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">1. Initial Consultation: Laying the Groundwork</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Your journey begins with a consultation, where the designer gets to know your lifestyle, preferences, and budget. This is your chance to share ideas, inspiration, and any specific requirements you have. Expect questions about how you use your space and what kind of atmosphere you want to create.
              <br></br>
              Pro Tip: Bring photos, Pinterest boards, or samples of things you love—visuals help the designer understand your style better.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">2. Design Concept & Mood Boards</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Based on your input, the designer will create a design concept or mood board. This includes color schemes, material suggestions, furniture styles, and overall aesthetics. It’s a creative phase where you’ll start to visualize how your future space will look and feel.
              <br></br>
              Pro Tip: Don’t hesitate to provide feedback. Open communication ensures the final design reflects your personality and needs.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">3. Budget Planning & Timeline</h2>
            <p className="mt-2">Next comes the practical planning. Your designer will outline a detailed budget, recommend vendors, and provide a timeline for project completion. This helps avoid unexpected costs and ensures everything runs smoothly.
              <br></br>
              Pro Tip: Be honest about your budget upfront so your designer can make smart, cost-effective choices that still align with your vision.

          <div className=" shadow-2xl rounded-lg p-6">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold ">4. Project Management & Installation</h2>
            <p className=" mt-2">Your designer may coordinate with contractors, electricians, and painters to execute the design plan. They’ll oversee the installation of furnishings and decor, ensuring everything comes together as envisioned.
              <br></br>
              Pro Tip: Trust the process—while some parts may seem slow or chaotic, designers are skilled at managing every detail behind the scenes.
